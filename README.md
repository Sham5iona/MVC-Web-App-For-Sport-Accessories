The purpose of the web application is to create a reliable, useful and extendable Sport Accessories online shop like the modern ones nowadays. The design pattern is MVC(Model-View-Controller).
It follows the SOLID principles and is open source therefore you can extends it however you want and achive extra functionality. The structure technologies of the web app are Identity Framework Core,
Entity Framework Core and ASP.Net Core. It uses all the provided managers by the Identity Framework. Also, a forgot password functionality is added by configuring a SMTP server and sending emails
by using two-factor-authentication. I hope you enjoy it! :)
